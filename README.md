# 🧠 SUICIDE ANALYSIS REPORT (2000–2016)

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global suicide trends and mental-health system capacity from the year 2000 to 2016. It combines SQL-based data exploration with Power BI visualization to uncover key insights that can support evidence-based public health decision-making.

---

## 📌 Background  
Understanding global mental-health trends is crucial for designing effective health policies and preventive strategies.  
This project analyzes suicide rates across multiple countries between **2000 and 2016**, focusing on:

- identifying high-risk countries  
- examining staff density across mental-health systems  
- exploring age-group distributions of suicide rates  
- visualizing multi-year trends  

Most existing reports present raw numbers without a deeper analytical context. This project fills that gap by applying **SQL exploration**, **Power BI dashboards**, and **comparative insights** to provide a clearer understanding of suicide dynamics globally and across Africa.

## 📥 Data Source  
The dataset used is publicly available on Kaggle:  
👉 **[Mental Health and Suicide Rates Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/twinkle0705/mental-health-and-suicide-rates)**

The dataset includes:  
- Suicide rates (2000–2016)  
- Gender distribution  
- Mental health hospital availability  
- Mental health staff density  
- Country-level metadata  

---

## 🔧 Tools Used  
- **SQL (Microsoft SQL Server / SSMS)**  
- **Power BI**  
- *(Optional) Python – can be added later)*

## 🧹 Data Cleaning  

Cleaning steps performed:

- Removed duplicate records  
- Removed null/empty fields  
- Treated outliers using logical boundaries  
- Ensured column name consistency  
- Validated age-group formats  
- Structured data for SQL querying

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key analytical questions addressed:

1. Which country has the highest suicide rate globally?  
2. Which African country had the highest suicide rate in 2016?  
3. Which age group has the highest suicide rate?  
4. Which country has the best mental health staff density?  
5. What age group in Africa has the most suicide prevalence?  
6. What are the overall suicide trends between 2000–2016?

## 📊 Result Analysis

- **Guyana recorded the highest global suicide rate**, making it the country with the most severe prevalence in the dataset.  

- **Uganda had the highest suicide rate in Africa in 2016**, highlighting a significant regional mental health burden.  

- **The year 2000 showed the highest suicide rates between 2000 and 2016**, indicating that subsequent years experienced either a decline or fluctuations.  

- **Egypt had the best mental-health staff density in Africa**, demonstrating stronger human-resource capacity compared to other African nations.  

- **Most countries reported their highest suicide rates among individuals aged 80+**, except for several lower-income countries where **younger age groups (20–29 years)** experienced higher rates—often linked to economic and social stressors.  

- **Zimbabwe had the fewest mental health hospitals globally in 2016**, reflecting severe infrastructural limitations.  

- **Norway had the highest mental-health staff density globally in 2016**, indicating strong investment in mental-health systems.

## 📌 Recommendations  

1. **Strengthen Mental Health Interventions in High-Risk Countries**  
   Countries like Guyana and Uganda should prioritize national mental-health strategies focused on early detection, suicide prevention programs, and public awareness campaigns.

2. **Invest in Mental-Health Workforce Development**  
   Nations with low staff density—especially African countries—should scale up training, recruitment, and retention of psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, and social workers.

3. **Increase Funding for Mental Health Infrastructure**  
   Countries with very few mental-health hospitals, such as Zimbabwe, require investment in building and equipping facilities to improve access.

4. **Target Younger Age Groups in Low-Income Countries**  
   Since poorer countries show higher suicide rates among people aged 20–29, governments should design youth-focused interventions:
   - job creation  
   - trauma counseling  
   - addiction treatment  
   - social support systems

5. **Age-Specific Suicide Prevention Programs**  
   Countries where suicide is high among the elderly (80+) need policies addressing:
   - healthcare affordability  
   - loneliness and isolation  
   - chronic disease management  

6. **Continuous Data Monitoring**  
   Governments should strengthen mental-health data collection systems for accurate annual tracking.

7. **International Collaboration**  
   Countries like Norway and Egypt can partner with low-resource nations to share knowledge and strengthen systems.

8. **Integrate Mental Health Services Into Primary Healthcare**  
   This improves access in remote areas and reduces pressure on specialized hospitals.

## 🏁 Conclusion  
This analysis highlights major global disparities in suicide rates, mental-health staffing, and service availability.  
By combining SQL exploration with Power BI visualization, the project uncovers patterns that can guide **policy reforms**, **resource allocation**, and **preventive interventions**.  
Mental health remains a global priority, and data-driven insights are essential for reducing suicide rates and improving well-being worldwide.
