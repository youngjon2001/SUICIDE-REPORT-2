# SUICIDE-REPORT-2
This portfolio is to showcase the suicide report from 2000 to 2016 
## BACKGROUND  
## 📌 Background  
Understanding global mental health patterns is important for designing effective health policies.  
This project analyzes suicide rate data from multiple countries between 2000 and 2016. Many previous reports present raw numbers without deeper analysis. This project fills that gap by using SQL to explore trends, identify high-risk regions, and uncover gender-based differences. Visualizations created with Power BI provide a clearer picture of the patterns.
This analysis aims to support data-driven decision-making for public health interventions.
